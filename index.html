<p>Technologies used</p>
<ul>
<li>ReactJS</li>
<li>ProPublia Congress API</li>
<li>Google Civic Representatives API</li>
<li>React Social Icons</li>
</ul>
<p>At first, I searched for an API that contained the polling election data I wanted. After a couple days of research, I settled on the Google Civic API because it seemed to have the most all-encompassing data nation-wide. Once I attempted to implement the data, I found that it was woefully incomplete. Further detective work revealed that there really is no single source of data for polling locations, which I believe is due to the fact that polling locations tend to change election-to-election. At this point, I had to pivot my project to a general idea I had of providing an information hub for representatives in Congress and in the Senate.</p>
<p>With some research help from Celeste, I landed on the ProPublica API, which had a bevy of details on the last 30-something sessions of Congress and the Senate. Having never worked with APIs before, I looked into other sites/repos where the ProPublica API was used to render data. Upon a few days of intense poring over, I was able to fetch some calls to work in the way I wanted my code to render, though the complexity of half the calls were a bit beyond my understanding. I connected with some classmates and the SRC and was able to bear fruit on the calls I was able to tackle in the timeframe allotted.</p>
<p>I'm happy with the progress I've made and what I'm learning regarding 3rd party APIs. I plan to build out the rest of this site with a smooth flow and clean yet striking layout.</p>
<p>Installation instructions for any dependencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>React Social Icons: npm install react-social-icons --save-dev</li>
</ul>
<p>User Stores:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a User, I want to quickly look up core issues for my local representatives/candidates for office so I can be an informed voter.</li>
<li>As a User, I want to pull up easy-to-read information for my local elections so I can be prepared to vote.</li>
<li>As a User, I want to share local information with my friends/network to improve my community.</li>
</ul>
