After a couple days of research, I settled on the Google Civic API because it seemed to have the most all-encompassing data nation-wide. Once I attempted to implement the data, I found that it was woefully incomplete. Further detective work revealed that there really is no single source of data for polling locations, which I believe is due to the fact that polling locations tend to change election-to-election. At this point, I had to pivot my project to a general idea I had of providing an information hub for representatives in Congress and in the Senate.\r\n\r\n With some research help from Celeste, I landed on the ProPublica API, which had a bevy of details on the last 30-something sessions of Congress and the Senate. Having never worked with APIs before, I looked into other sites/repos where the ProPublica API was used to render data. Upon a few days of intense poring over, I was able to fetch some calls to work in the way I wanted my code to render, though the complexity of half the calls were a bit beyond my understanding. I connected with some classmates and the SRC and was able to bear fruit on the calls I was able to tackle in the timeframe allotted.\r\n\r\n I'm happy with the progress I've made and what I'm learning regarding 3rd party APIs. I plan to build out the rest of this site with a smooth flow and clean yet striking layout.\r\n\r\nInstallation instructions for any dependencies:\r\n - React Social Icons: npm install react-social-icons --save-dev\r\n\r\nUser Stores:\r\n - As a User, I want to quickly look up core issues for my local representatives/candidates for office so I can be an informed voter.\r\n - As a User, I want to pull up easy-to-read information for my local elections so I can be prepared to vote.\r\n - As a User, I want to share local information with my friends/network to improve my community.\r\n\r\nWireframes:\r\n  ![image](https://i.imgur.com/eynhXyP.png)\r\n  ![image](https://i.imgur.com/3Mo9ZOU.png)\r\n  ![image](https://i.imgur.com/RFEyciN.png)\r\n  ![image](https://i.imgur.com/PT8yzKZ.png)\r\n\r\nDescriptions of any unsolved problems or major hurdles you had to overcome\r\n - Hurdles:\r\n  - Finding an API with recent and upcoming election dat & polling locations\r\n  - Rendering information from my API within a confusing set of arrays holding objects, and setting them to state\r\n - Unsolved Problems:\r\n  - Blending Google Civic API with the ProPublica API\r\n  - Blending the images from bioguide.congress.gov with the Google Civic API\r\n  - Filtering senators/representatives by state\r\n - Time Constraints:\r\n  - Incomplete Bills, Expenses, and Search Address Components\r\n",
